# Grid Game

This is turn-based tile strategy game that I began working on during finals week of my spring 2014 quarter. Pretty much the most complex program I have ever attempted to create. A lot of the ideas are pre-drafted, but still not implemented. Eventually I moved on to other projects after about 3 weeks, but I still plan to continue working on this eventually when I have more motivation.

The game is coded in Java.
